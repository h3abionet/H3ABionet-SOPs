This website hosts the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for common data analysis tasks within the [H3ABioNet](https://h3abionet.org/) consortium. 

The following have associated node accreditation exercises:


* [Human Variant calling]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link pages/genomics_analysis/Variant-Calling/Variant-Calling-1-0.md %})
* [Genome Wide Association Studies]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link pages/genomics_analysis/GWAS/GWAS.md %})
* [Gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link pages/genomics_analysis/RNA-Seq/RNA-Seq-1-0.md %})
* [16S microbiome analysis]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link  pages/genomics_analysis/16s-rRNA/16s-rRNA-1-0.md %})

In addition, we have additional SOPs that cover some of the reporting and review process:

* [Reviewers of node accreditation reports]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link pages/misc/reviewers.md %})

These SOPs are meant to help various H3ABioNet nodes in their accreditation exercises [^1], as per [this protocol]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Assessment_protocol.pdf ).

You can use the buttons at the top of the page to navigate those various SOPs, or the side panel to access the subsections within each.

Feedback is also welcome! Please feel free to [fork this repo](https://github.com/h3abionet/H3ABionet-SOPs), open an issue or a pull request. Additionally, check out our [contribution guide]({{ site.baseurl}}{% link pages/contributing/cont_tech-guide-1.md %}).
